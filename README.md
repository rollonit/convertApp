# Convert

## Basic Unit Conversion App

### By: **Rohan Pradyumna Gundala**

This is the submission for the first assignment (Utility App) of CP3409 mobile computing class.

I accidentally set the API level to _31 (Android 12.0)_. This is way too new, but I was unable
to change it later without breaking everything. I apologise, and I hope it's not too much trouble.

It was edited and built using _Android Studio Flamingo (2022.2.1)_.

I have also compiled an APK and placed it in the OUT folder.

The side menu allows for the picking of various types of units for conversion.

While I was coding it, I personally tracked my changes using git, and therefore, the project is a personal git repository. This also means that the complete commit history can be viewed.
